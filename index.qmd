# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a Quarto book containing my notes as I work through @mcelreath_statistical_2020, using also the accompanying [YouTube lecture videos (2023)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus), and @kurz_statistical_2023. I'm working through the book as part of a bi-weekly meeting with members of the ZAS Berlin, with shared materials available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Onurunki/Bayesian-Statistics-at-ZAS).
